//wap for SELECTION SORT by "no return but argument ".

/*
Selection sort is one of the basic algorithms for sorting data, its simplicity proves useful for sorting 
small amounts of data. Selection sort works by first starting at the beginning array (index 0) and traverses
the entire array comparing each value with the current index, if it is smaller than the current index than that
 index is saved. Once the loop has traversed all the data and if a smaller value than the current index was
found a swap is made between the current index in the index where the smaller value was found.
The current index is then incremented, now to index 1, the algorithm repeats.
